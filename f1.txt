1. Write a Python program to compute the following descriptive statistics for both Study_Hours and Exam_Score:

 Mean

 Median

 Standard Deviation (6 Marks)
Assume that the Exam_Score follows a normal distribution.

b)Write a Python program to calculate the probability that a randomly selected student scores more than 75 marks. (2 Marks)

c) Plot a histogram for Exam_Score and interpret whether the distribution appears normal or skewed. (2 Marks)

d) Based on the statistical results, briefly explain the relationship between study hours and exam performance. (2 Marks)


import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm

study_hrs = np.array([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14])
score = np.array([45, 50, 60, 70, 78, 85, 90])

print("Study Hours")
print("Mean:", np.mean(study_hrs))
print("Median:", np.median(study_hrs))
print("Std Dev:", np.std(study_hrs))

print("\nExam Scores")
print("Mean:", np.mean(score))
print("Median:", np.median(score))
print("Std Dev:", np.std(score))


#b)Assume that the Exam_Score follows a normal distribution. Write a Python program to calculate the probability
#that a randomly selected student scores more than 75 marks. (2 Marks)
prob = 1 - norm.cdf(75, np.mean(score), np.std(score))
print("\nProbability of scoring more than 75:", prob)
#This Python code snippet calculates the probability that a randomly selected score is greater than 75, assuming the scores follow a normal distribution.
#Here is a breakdown of the formula:
#np.mean(score): Calculates the average value of the data set.
#np.std(score): Calculates the standard deviation (spread) of the data set.
#norm.cdf(75, mean, std): scipy.stats.norm.cdf calculates the Cumulative Distribution Function.
#This function returns the probability that a value is less than or equal to 75.
#1 - ...: Since the total probability under a normal curve is 1, subtracting the CDF result from 1 gives the upper tail: the probability that a value is greater than 75.
